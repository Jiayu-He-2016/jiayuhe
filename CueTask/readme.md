Spatial Memory Cue Task

This is a visual working memory task.
Participants will view a brief memory display of 2, 4, or 6 shapes (e.g., red triangle) that are randomly positioned at fixed spatial locations.

After a short delay, a **retrocue** will appear in the middle of the screen:
- **Object-based cue**: the exact object (e.g., red triangle)
- **Feature-based cue**: a color blob or shape outline (e.g., red or triangle)

Then, a **black dot probe** will appear at one of the positions previously occupied by a shape in the memory display.

Participants must decide whether the cued object or feature (**retrocue**) was originally presented at the probe's (**black dot probe**) location.
Response with key:
- **Left arrow** = YES (the cued object/feature was at this location)
- **Right arrow** = NO (the cued object/feature was not at this location)
